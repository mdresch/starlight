Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework. This guide will help you get started with a new project. See the manual setup instructions to add Starlight to an existing Astro project.

## Quick Start
### Create a new project

Create a new Astro + Starlight project by running the following command in your terminal:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Import the component into your MDX file:

   ```js
   import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
   ```

2. Wrap `<Steps>` around your ordered list items.

</Steps>

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">Io, Europa, Ganymede</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">Callisto, Amalthea, Himalia</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```npm title="npm" 
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```
```pnpm title="pnpm"
pnpm create astro --template starlight
```
```yarn title="yarn"
yarn create astro --template starlight
```
This will create a new project directory with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

### Start the development server
When working locally, Astro’s development server lets you preview your work and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes.

Inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

```npm title="npm" 
npm run dev
```
```pnpm title="pnpm"
pnpm dev
```
```yarn title="yarn"
yarn dev
```
This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview. Open this URL to start browsing your site.

### Add content
Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

Add new pages to your site by creating Markdown files in the src/content/docs/ directory.

Read more about file-based routing and support for MDX and Markdoc files in the “Pages” guide.
